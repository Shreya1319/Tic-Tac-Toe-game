This Python script creates a simple Tic Tac Toe game with the tkinter library as the GUI.
The print_board function shows the current status of the Tic Tac Toe board.
The check_win function determines whether a player has won by inspecting the board's rows, columns, and diagonals.

When a player clicks on a button (which represents a cell on the board), the method on_button_click is invoked. It changes the board's status and checks for a win or tie.
The reset_game function resets the game's state.
The tic_tac_toe method sets up the game's GUI with tkinter.
At the end of the script, tic_tac_toe() is invoked to begin the game.
